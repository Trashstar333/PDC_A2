# PDC-Quiz
*This is for PDC Project 2*

This project is a quiz like game where a user is able to login with a username & password.
They then enter the games main menu which consists of several options.

The game will consist of multiple game modes, a default one where there is no buy-in to play,
they will then continiously be asked general knowledge questions and awarded with in-game currency for each
question they answer correctly, they can choose to quit at any point & return to the main menu.

The other game modes will be similar except there is a buy-in cost, but they have the chance to earn
more money. If they answer a question incorrectly they will lose that game & the money they paid to enter,
but if they answer all the questions correctly they are awarded handsomely.

There is an underlying SQL database consisting of users and their amount of money, aswell as all the questions
that can be asked in the game along with correct/incorrect answers.
